# hello_world
A random useless project. #MyFirstRepository

Hi. I am a random github newbie.
This is a README.md file...

While reading this, one may ask,"What am I doing with my life?".
And that is the same question I asked myself 15 minutes ago, when i decided to open up this github.

If you're really bored...
Then solve this:
Dknn Icvgu
Hint: A = C, Z = B
If you can't solve this, you can't pass the 2nd challenge of the python challenge (http://www.pythonchallenge.com).
